	abstract = {We present a new method for predicting the secondary structure of globular proteins based on non-linear neural network models. Network models learn from existing protein structures how to predict the secondary structure of local sequences of amino acids. The average success rate of our method on a testing set of proteins non-homologous with the corresponding training set was 64.3\% on three types of secondary structure (alpha-helix, beta-sheet, and coil), with correlation coefficients of C alpha = 0.41, C beta = 0.31 and Ccoil = 0.41. These quality indices are all higher than those of previous methods. The prediction accuracy for the first 25 residues of the N-terminal sequence was significantly better. We conclude from computational experiments on real and artificial structures that no method based solely on local information in the protein sequence is likely to produce significantly better results for non-homologous proteins. The performance of our method of homologous proteins is much better than for non-homologous proteins, but is not as good as simply assuming that homologous sequences have identical structures.},

Significant improvement in accuracy is obtained as compared with performance on smaller databases. A systematic study of the effects of network topology shows that, for the larger database, better results are obtained with more units in the hidden layer. In a 32-fold cross validated test, secondary structure prediction accuracy is 67.0\%, relative to 62.6\% obtained previously, without any evolutionary information on the sequence. Introduction of sequence profiles increases this value to 72.9\%, suggesting that the two types of information are essentially independent. Tertiary structural class is predicted with 80.2\% accuracy, relative to 73.9\% obtained previously. The use of a larger database is facilitated by the introduction of a scaled conjugate gradient algorithm for optimizing the neural network. This algorithm is about 10-20 times as fast as the standard steepest descent algorithm.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss {AdaMax}, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Using a large scale analysis of parallel and antiparallel beta-sheets in a non-redundant dataset of proteins, we observed that most of the amino acids show significant under- or over-representation in at least one of the positions at the two ends of beta-sheets, which are denoted as N-cap and C-cap. In addition, based on statistical data and structural comparison, we found that certain amino acids, especially Asp, Asn, Gly and Pro have strong tendencies to block beta-sheet continuation. Hence, we can consider these residues as beta-sheet terminators. It was also proposed that the dipole moments in parallel beta-sheets, whose direction is from C-terminal (partially negative) to N-terminal (partially positive), are much stronger than has previously been suggested. In fact, enhancement of dipole moments in parallel beta-sheets is a result of the positioning of positively charged residues at N-cap and negatively charged residues at C-cap. This enhancement in dipole moment magnitude leads to strengthened dipolar interactions between parallel beta-sheets dipoles and other partners especially alpha-helices dipoles. The results provide an explanation for the antiparallel alignment of parallel beta-sheets with alpha-helices.},

Helix contents were measured by {CD} spectroscopy to obtain rank orders of capping preferences. The data were further analyzed by our modified Lifson-Roig helix-coil theory, which includes capping parameters (n and c), to find free energies of capping (-{RT} ln n and -{RT} ln c), relative to Ala. Results were obtained for charged and uncharged termini and for different charged states of titratable side chains. N-cap preferences varied from Asn (best) to Gln (worst). We find, as expected, that amino acids that can accept hydrogen bonds from otherwise free backbone {NH} groups, such as Asn, Asp, Ser, Thr, and Cys generally have the highest N-cap preference. Gly and acetyl group are favored, as are negative charges in side chains and at the N-terminus. Our N-cap preference scale agrees well with preferences in proteins. In contrast, we find little variation when changing the identity of the C-cap residue. We find no preference for Gly at the C-cap in contrast to the situation in proteins. Both N-cap and C-cap results for Tyr and Trp are inaccurate because their aromatic groups affect the {CD} spectrum. The data presented here are of value in rationalizing mutations at capping sites in proteins and in predicting the helix contents of peptides.},

Instead, such groups are often capped by alternative hydrogen bond partners. This review enlarges our earlier hypothesis (Presta {LG}, Rose {GD}. 1988. Helix signals in proteins. Science 240:1632-1641) to include hydrophobic capping. A hydrophobic interaction that straddles the helix terminus is always associated with hydrogen-bonded capping. From a global survey among proteins of known structure, seven distinct capping motifs are identified-three at the helix N-terminus and four at the C-terminus. The consensus sequence patterns of these seven motifs, together with results from simple molecular modeling, are used to formulate useful rules of thumb for helix termination.

	abstract = {A computer program is described that produces a description of the secondary structure and supersecondary structure of a polypeptide chain using the list of alpha carbon coordinates as input. Restricting the term "secondary structure" to the conformation of contiguous segments of the chain, the program determines the initial and final residues in helices, extended strands, sharp turns, and omega loops. This is accomplished through the use of difference distance matrices. The distances in idealized models of the segments are compared with the actual structure, and the differences are evaluated for agreement within preset limits. The program assigns 90-95\% of the residues in most proteins to at least one type of secondary element. In a second step the now-defined helices and strands are idealized as straight line segments, and the axial directions and locations are compiled from the input C alpha coordinate list. These data are used to check for moderate curvature in strands and helices, and the secondary structure list is corrected where necessary. The geometric relations between these line segments are then calculated and output as the first level of supersecondary structure. A maximum of six parameters are required for a complete description of the relations between each pair. Frequently a less complete description will suffice, for example just the interaxial separation and angle. Both the secondary structure and one aspect of the supersecondary structure can be displayed in a character matrix analogous to the distance matrix format. This allows a quite accurate two-dimensional display of the three-dimensional structure, and several examples are presented. A procedure for searching for arbitrary substructures in proteins using distance matrices is also described. A search for the {DNA} binding helix-turn-helix motif in the Protein Data Bank serves as an example. A further abstraction of the above data can be made in the form of a metamatrix where each diagonal element represents an entire secondary segment rather than a single atom, and the off-diagonal elements contain all the parameters describing their interrelations. Such matrices can be used in a straightforward search for higher levels of supersecondary structure or used in toto as a representation of the entire tertiary structure of the polypeptide chain.},

Three major programs which automatically determine the location of helices and strands are used for this purpose, namely {DSSP}, P-Curve and Define. Their results have been compared for a non-redundant database of 154 proteins. On a residue per residue basis, the percentage match score is only 63\% between the three methods. While these methods agree on the overall number of residues in each of the three states (helix, strand or coil), they differ on the number of helices or strands, thus implying a wide discrepancy in the length of assigned structural elements. Moreover, the length distribution of helices and strands points to the existence of artefacts inherent to each assignment algorithm. To overcome these difficulties a consensus assignment is proposed where each residue is assigned to the state determined by at least two of the three methods. With this assignment the artefacts of each algorithm are attenuated. The residues assigned in the same state by the three methods are better predicted than the others. This assignment will thus be useful for analysing the success rate of prediction methods more accurately.},

Here, we propose a criterion that assesses secondary structure assignment based on the similarity of the secondary structures assigned to pairwise sequence-alignment benchmarks, where these benchmarks are determined by prior structural alignments of the protein pairs. This criterion is used to rank six secondary structure assignment methods: {STRIDE}, {DSSP}, {SECSTR}, {KAKSI}, P-{SEA}, and {SEGNO} with three established sequence-alignment benchmarks ({PREFAB}, {SABmark}, and {SALIGN}). {STRIDE} and {KAKSI} achieve comparable success rates in assigning the same secondary structure elements to structurally aligned residues in the three benchmarks. Their success rates are between 1-4\% higher than those of the other four methods. The consensus of {STRIDE}, {KAKSI}, {SECSTR}, and P-{SEA}, called {SKSP}, improves assignments over the best single method in each benchmark by an additional 1\%. These results support the usefulness of the sequence-alignment benchmarks as a means to evaluate secondary structure assignment.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A number of methods are now available to perform automatic assignment of periodic secondary structures from atomic coordinates, based on different characteristics of the secondary structures. In general these methods exhibit a broad consensus as to the location of most helix and strand core segments in protein structures. However the termini of the segments are often ill-defined and it is difficult to decide unambiguously which residues at the edge of the segments have to be included. In addition, there is a "twilight zone" where secondary structure segments depart significantly from the idealized models of Pauling and Corey. For these segments, one has to decide whether the observed structural variations are merely distorsions or whether they constitute a break in the secondary structure.
{METHODS}: To address these problems, we have developed a method for secondary structure assignment, called {KAKSI}. Assignments made by {KAKSI} are compared with assignments given by {DSSP}, {STRIDE}, {XTLSSTR}, {PSEA} and {SECSTR}, as well as secondary structures found in {PDB} files, on 4 datasets (X-ray structures with different resolution range, {NMR} structures).
{RESULTS}: A detailed comparison of {KAKSI} assignments with those of {STRIDE} and {PSEA} reveals that {KAKSI} assigns slightly longer helices and strands than {STRIDE} in case of one-to-one correspondence between the segments. However, {KAKSI} tends also to favor the assignment of several short helices when {STRIDE} and {PSEA} assign longer, kinked, helices. Helices assigned by {KAKSI} have geometrical characteristics close to those described in the {PDB}. They are more linear than helices assigned by other methods. The same tendency to split long segments is observed for strands, although less systematically. We present a number of cases of secondary structure assignments that illustrate this behavior.
{CONCLUSION}: Our method provides valuable assignments which favor the regularity of secondary structure segments.},

	abstract = {Secondary structure assignment codes were built to explore the regularities associated with the periodic motifs of proteins, such as those in backbone dihedral angles or in hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms. Precise structure assignment is challenging because real-life secondary structures are susceptible to bending, twist, fraying and other deformations that can distance them from their geometrical prototypes. Although results from codes such as {DSSP} and {STRIDE} converge in well-ordered structures, the agreement between the secondary structure assignments is known to deteriorate as the conformations become more distorted. Conformationally irregular peptides therefore offer a great opportunity to explore the differences between these codes. This is especially important for unfolded proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins, which are known to exhibit residual and/or transient secondary structure whose characterization is challenging. In this work, we have carried out Molecular Dynamics simulations of (relatively) disordered peptides, specifically gp41659-671 ({ELLELDKWASLWN}), the homopeptide polyasparagine (N18), and polyasparagine dimers. We have analyzed the resulting conformations with {DSSP} and {STRIDE}, based on hydrogen-bond patterns (and dihedral angles for {STRIDE}), and {KAKSI}, based on α-Carbon distances; and carefully characterized the differences in structural assignments. The full-sequence Segment Overlap ({SOV}) scores, that quantify the agreement between two secondary structure assignments, vary from 70\% for gp41659-671 ({STRIDE} as reference) to 49\% for N18 ({DSSP} as reference). Major differences are observed in turns, in the distinction between α and 310 helices, and in short parallel-sheet segments.},

	abstract = {We present a new method for predicting the secondary structure of globular proteins based on non-linear neural network models. Network models learn from existing protein structures how to predict the secondary structure of local sequences of amino acids. The average success rate of our method on a testing set of proteins non-homologous with the corresponding training set was 64.3\% on three types of secondary structure (alpha-helix, beta-sheet, and coil), with correlation coefficients of C alpha = 0.41, C beta = 0.31 and Ccoil = 0.41. These quality indices are all higher than those of previous methods. The prediction accuracy for the first 25 residues of the N-terminal sequence was significantly better. We conclude from computational experiments on real and artificial structures that no method based solely on local information in the protein sequence is likely to produce significantly better results for non-homologous proteins. The performance of our method of homologous proteins is much better than for non-homologous proteins, but is not as good as simply assuming that homologous sequences have identical structures.},

Significant improvement in accuracy is obtained as compared with performance on smaller databases. A systematic study of the effects of network topology shows that, for the larger database, better results are obtained with more units in the hidden layer. In a 32-fold cross validated test, secondary structure prediction accuracy is 67.0\%, relative to 62.6\% obtained previously, without any evolutionary information on the sequence. Introduction of sequence profiles increases this value to 72.9\%, suggesting that the two types of information are essentially independent. Tertiary structural class is predicted with 80.2\% accuracy, relative to 73.9\% obtained previously. The use of a larger database is facilitated by the introduction of a scaled conjugate gradient algorithm for optimizing the neural network. This algorithm is about 10-20 times as fast as the standard steepest descent algorithm.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss {AdaMax}, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Using a large scale analysis of parallel and antiparallel beta-sheets in a non-redundant dataset of proteins, we observed that most of the amino acids show significant under- or over-representation in at least one of the positions at the two ends of beta-sheets, which are denoted as N-cap and C-cap. In addition, based on statistical data and structural comparison, we found that certain amino acids, especially Asp, Asn, Gly and Pro have strong tendencies to block beta-sheet continuation. Hence, we can consider these residues as beta-sheet terminators. It was also proposed that the dipole moments in parallel beta-sheets, whose direction is from C-terminal (partially negative) to N-terminal (partially positive), are much stronger than has previously been suggested. In fact, enhancement of dipole moments in parallel beta-sheets is a result of the positioning of positively charged residues at N-cap and negatively charged residues at C-cap. This enhancement in dipole moment magnitude leads to strengthened dipolar interactions between parallel beta-sheets dipoles and other partners especially alpha-helices dipoles. The results provide an explanation for the antiparallel alignment of parallel beta-sheets with alpha-helices.},

Helix contents were measured by {CD} spectroscopy to obtain rank orders of capping preferences. The data were further analyzed by our modified Lifson-Roig helix-coil theory, which includes capping parameters (n and c), to find free energies of capping (-{RT} ln n and -{RT} ln c), relative to Ala. Results were obtained for charged and uncharged termini and for different charged states of titratable side chains. N-cap preferences varied from Asn (best) to Gln (worst). We find, as expected, that amino acids that can accept hydrogen bonds from otherwise free backbone {NH} groups, such as Asn, Asp, Ser, Thr, and Cys generally have the highest N-cap preference. Gly and acetyl group are favored, as are negative charges in side chains and at the N-terminus. Our N-cap preference scale agrees well with preferences in proteins. In contrast, we find little variation when changing the identity of the C-cap residue. We find no preference for Gly at the C-cap in contrast to the situation in proteins. Both N-cap and C-cap results for Tyr and Trp are inaccurate because their aromatic groups affect the {CD} spectrum. The data presented here are of value in rationalizing mutations at capping sites in proteins and in predicting the helix contents of peptides.},

Instead, such groups are often capped by alternative hydrogen bond partners. This review enlarges our earlier hypothesis (Presta {LG}, Rose {GD}. 1988. Helix signals in proteins. Science 240:1632-1641) to include hydrophobic capping. A hydrophobic interaction that straddles the helix terminus is always associated with hydrogen-bonded capping. From a global survey among proteins of known structure, seven distinct capping motifs are identified-three at the helix N-terminus and four at the C-terminus. The consensus sequence patterns of these seven motifs, together with results from simple molecular modeling, are used to formulate useful rules of thumb for helix termination.

	abstract = {A computer program is described that produces a description of the secondary structure and supersecondary structure of a polypeptide chain using the list of alpha carbon coordinates as input. Restricting the term "secondary structure" to the conformation of contiguous segments of the chain, the program determines the initial and final residues in helices, extended strands, sharp turns, and omega loops. This is accomplished through the use of difference distance matrices. The distances in idealized models of the segments are compared with the actual structure, and the differences are evaluated for agreement within preset limits. The program assigns 90-95\% of the residues in most proteins to at least one type of secondary element. In a second step the now-defined helices and strands are idealized as straight line segments, and the axial directions and locations are compiled from the input C alpha coordinate list. These data are used to check for moderate curvature in strands and helices, and the secondary structure list is corrected where necessary. The geometric relations between these line segments are then calculated and output as the first level of supersecondary structure. A maximum of six parameters are required for a complete description of the relations between each pair. Frequently a less complete description will suffice, for example just the interaxial separation and angle. Both the secondary structure and one aspect of the supersecondary structure can be displayed in a character matrix analogous to the distance matrix format. This allows a quite accurate two-dimensional display of the three-dimensional structure, and several examples are presented. A procedure for searching for arbitrary substructures in proteins using distance matrices is also described. A search for the {DNA} binding helix-turn-helix motif in the Protein Data Bank serves as an example. A further abstraction of the above data can be made in the form of a metamatrix where each diagonal element represents an entire secondary segment rather than a single atom, and the off-diagonal elements contain all the parameters describing their interrelations. Such matrices can be used in a straightforward search for higher levels of supersecondary structure or used in toto as a representation of the entire tertiary structure of the polypeptide chain.},

Three major programs which automatically determine the location of helices and strands are used for this purpose, namely {DSSP}, P-Curve and Define. Their results have been compared for a non-redundant database of 154 proteins. On a residue per residue basis, the percentage match score is only 63\% between the three methods. While these methods agree on the overall number of residues in each of the three states (helix, strand or coil), they differ on the number of helices or strands, thus implying a wide discrepancy in the length of assigned structural elements. Moreover, the length distribution of helices and strands points to the existence of artefacts inherent to each assignment algorithm. To overcome these difficulties a consensus assignment is proposed where each residue is assigned to the state determined by at least two of the three methods. With this assignment the artefacts of each algorithm are attenuated. The residues assigned in the same state by the three methods are better predicted than the others. This assignment will thus be useful for analysing the success rate of prediction methods more accurately.},

Here, we propose a criterion that assesses secondary structure assignment based on the similarity of the secondary structures assigned to pairwise sequence-alignment benchmarks, where these benchmarks are determined by prior structural alignments of the protein pairs. This criterion is used to rank six secondary structure assignment methods: {STRIDE}, {DSSP}, {SECSTR}, {KAKSI}, P-{SEA}, and {SEGNO} with three established sequence-alignment benchmarks ({PREFAB}, {SABmark}, and {SALIGN}). {STRIDE} and {KAKSI} achieve comparable success rates in assigning the same secondary structure elements to structurally aligned residues in the three benchmarks. Their success rates are between 1-4\% higher than those of the other four methods. The consensus of {STRIDE}, {KAKSI}, {SECSTR}, and P-{SEA}, called {SKSP}, improves assignments over the best single method in each benchmark by an additional 1\%. These results support the usefulness of the sequence-alignment benchmarks as a means to evaluate secondary structure assignment.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A number of methods are now available to perform automatic assignment of periodic secondary structures from atomic coordinates, based on different characteristics of the secondary structures. In general these methods exhibit a broad consensus as to the location of most helix and strand core segments in protein structures. However the termini of the segments are often ill-defined and it is difficult to decide unambiguously which residues at the edge of the segments have to be included. In addition, there is a "twilight zone" where secondary structure segments depart significantly from the idealized models of Pauling and Corey. For these segments, one has to decide whether the observed structural variations are merely distorsions or whether they constitute a break in the secondary structure.
{METHODS}: To address these problems, we have developed a method for secondary structure assignment, called {KAKSI}. Assignments made by {KAKSI} are compared with assignments given by {DSSP}, {STRIDE}, {XTLSSTR}, {PSEA} and {SECSTR}, as well as secondary structures found in {PDB} files, on 4 datasets (X-ray structures with different resolution range, {NMR} structures).
{RESULTS}: A detailed comparison of {KAKSI} assignments with those of {STRIDE} and {PSEA} reveals that {KAKSI} assigns slightly longer helices and strands than {STRIDE} in case of one-to-one correspondence between the segments. However, {KAKSI} tends also to favor the assignment of several short helices when {STRIDE} and {PSEA} assign longer, kinked, helices. Helices assigned by {KAKSI} have geometrical characteristics close to those described in the {PDB}. They are more linear than helices assigned by other methods. The same tendency to split long segments is observed for strands, although less systematically. We present a number of cases of secondary structure assignments that illustrate this behavior.
{CONCLUSION}: Our method provides valuable assignments which favor the regularity of secondary structure segments.},

	abstract = {Secondary structure assignment codes were built to explore the regularities associated with the periodic motifs of proteins, such as those in backbone dihedral angles or in hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms. Precise structure assignment is challenging because real-life secondary structures are susceptible to bending, twist, fraying and other deformations that can distance them from their geometrical prototypes. Although results from codes such as {DSSP} and {STRIDE} converge in well-ordered structures, the agreement between the secondary structure assignments is known to deteriorate as the conformations become more distorted. Conformationally irregular peptides therefore offer a great opportunity to explore the differences between these codes. This is especially important for unfolded proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins, which are known to exhibit residual and/or transient secondary structure whose characterization is challenging. In this work, we have carried out Molecular Dynamics simulations of (relatively) disordered peptides, specifically gp41659-671 ({ELLELDKWASLWN}), the homopeptide polyasparagine (N18), and polyasparagine dimers. We have analyzed the resulting conformations with {DSSP} and {STRIDE}, based on hydrogen-bond patterns (and dihedral angles for {STRIDE}), and {KAKSI}, based on α-Carbon distances; and carefully characterized the differences in structural assignments. The full-sequence Segment Overlap ({SOV}) scores, that quantify the agreement between two secondary structure assignments, vary from 70\% for gp41659-671 ({STRIDE} as reference) to 49\% for N18 ({DSSP} as reference). Major differences are observed in turns, in the distinction between α and 310 helices, and in short parallel-sheet segments.},

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the {BLAST} programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped {BLAST} program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by {BLAST} into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated {BLAST} ({PSI}-{BLAST}) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped {BLAST}, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. {PSI}-{BLAST} is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the {BRCT} superfamily.},

	abstract = {Under physiological conditions, a protein undergoes a spontaneous disorder ⇌ order transition called “folding.” The protein polymer is highly flexible when unfolded but adopts its unique native, three-dimensional structure when folded. Current experimental knowledge comes primarily from thermodynamic measurements in solution or the structures of individual molecules, elucidated by either x-ray crystallography or {NMR} spectroscopy. From the former, we know the enthalpy, entropy, and free energy differences between the folded and unfolded forms of hundreds of proteins under a variety of solvent/cosolvent conditions. From the latter, we know the structures of ≈35,000 proteins, which are built on scaffolds of hydrogen-bonded structural elements, α-helix and β-sheet. Anfinsen showed that the amino acid sequence alone is sufficient to determine a protein's structure, but the molecular mechanism responsible for self-assembly remains an open question, probably the most fundamental open question in biochemistry. This perspective is a hybrid: partly review, partly proposal. First, we summarize key ideas regarding protein folding developed over the past half-century and culminating in the current mindset. In this view, the energetics of side-chain interactions dominate the folding process, driving the chain to self-organize under folding conditions. Next, having taken stock, we propose an alternative model that inverts the prevailing side-chain/backbone paradigm. Here, the energetics of backbone hydrogen bonds dominate the folding process, with preorganization in the unfolded state. Then, under folding conditions, the resultant fold is selected from a limited repertoire of structural possibilities, each corresponding to a distinct hydrogen-bonded arrangement of α-helices and/or strands of β-sheet.},

	abstract = {We consider the differences between the many-pathway protein folding model derived from theoretical energy landscape considerations and the defined-pathway model derived from experiment. A basic tenet of the energy landscape model is that proteins fold through many heterogeneous pathways by way of amino acid-level dynamics biased toward selecting native-like interactions. The many pathways imagined in the model are not observed in the structure-formation stage of folding by experiments that would have found them, but they have now been detected and characterized for one protein in the initial prenucleation stage. Analysis presented here shows that these many microscopic trajectories are not distinct in any functionally significant way, and they have neither the structural information nor the biased energetics needed to select native vs. nonnative interactions during folding. The opposed defined-pathway model stems from experimental results that show that proteins are assemblies of small cooperative units called foldons and that a number of proteins fold in a reproducible pathway one foldon unit at a time. Thus, the same foldon interactions that encode the native structure of any given protein also naturally encode its particular foldon-based folding pathway, and they collectively sum to produce the energy bias toward native interactions that is necessary for efficient folding. Available information suggests that quantized native structure and stepwise folding coevolved in ancient repeat proteins and were retained as a functional pair due to their utility for solving the difficult protein folding problem.},

In the first part of this article, we focus on a few reasons as to why the solution to the protein-folding problem ({PFP}) has been elusive for a very long time. One is a result of the misinterpretation of Anfinsen's Thermodynamic hypothesis which led to the conclusion that the native structure of a protein must be at a global minimum of the Gibbs energy. The second is the result of the adherence to the hydrophobic paradigm, and at the same time ignoring a whole repertoire of hydrophilic effects. It is argued that switching from a target-based to a caused-based approach, and adopting the hydrophilic paradigm leads straightforwardly to a simple answer to Levinthal's question, as well as to a solution of the {PFP}.},

The 10 {CASP} experiments span almost 20 years of progress in the field of protein structure modeling, and there have been enormous advances in methods and model accuracy in that period. Notable in this round is the first sustained improvement of models with refinement methods, using molecular dynamics. For the first time, we tested the ability of modeling methods to make use of sparse experimental three-dimensional contact information, such as may be obtained from new experimental techniques, with encouraging results. On the other hand, new contact prediction methods, though holding considerable promise, have yet to make an impact in {CASP} testing. The nature of {CASP} targets has been changing in recent {CASPs}, reflecting shifts in experimental structural biology, with more irregular structures, more multi-domain and multi-subunit structures, and less standard versions of known folds. When allowance is made for these factors, we continue to see steady progress in the overall accuracy of models, particularly resulting from improvement of non-template regions.},

Throughout the past five decades, many different algorithmic approaches have been attempted, and although progress has been made the problem remains unsolvable even for many small proteins. While the general objective is to predict the three-dimensional structure from primary sequence, our current knowledge and computational power are simply insufficient to solve a problem of such high complexity., Some prediction algorithms do, however, appear to perform better than others, although it is not always obvious which ones they are and it is perhaps even less obvious why that is. In this review, the reported performance results from 18 different recently published prediction algorithms are compared. Furthermore, the general algorithmic settings most likely responsible for the difference in the reported performance are identified, and the specific settings of each of the 18 prediction algorithms are also compared., The average normalized r.m.s.d. scores reported range from 11.17 to 3.48. With a performance measure including both r.m.s.d. scores and {CPU} time, the currently best-performing prediction algorithm is identified to be the I-{TASSER} algorithm. Two of the algorithmic settings—protein representation and fragment assembly—were found to have definite positive influence on the running time and the predicted structures, respectively. There thus appears to be a clear benefit from incorporating this knowledge in the design of new prediction algorithms.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Prediction of 3-dimensional protein structures from amino acid sequences represents one of the most important problems in computational structural biology. The community-wide Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction ({CASP}) experiments have been designed to obtain an objective assessment of the state-of-the-art of the field, where I-{TASSER} was ranked as the best method in the server section of the recent 7th {CASP} experiment. Our laboratory has since then received numerous requests about the public availability of the I-{TASSER} algorithm and the usage of the I-{TASSER} predictions.
{RESULTS}: An on-line version of I-{TASSER} is developed at the {KU} Center for Bioinformatics which has generated protein structure predictions for thousands of modeling requests from more than 35 countries. A scoring function (C-score) based on the relative clustering structural density and the consensus significance score of multiple threading templates is introduced to estimate the accuracy of the I-{TASSER} predictions. A large-scale benchmark test demonstrates a strong correlation between the C-score and the {TM}-score (a structural similarity measurement with values in [0, 1]) of the first models with a correlation coefficient of 0.91. Using a C-score cutoff {\textgreater} -1.5 for the models of correct topology, both false positive and false negative rates are below 0.1. Combining C-score and protein length, the accuracy of the I-{TASSER} models can be predicted with an average error of 0.08 for {TM}-score and 2 A for {RMSD}.
{CONCLUSION}: The I-{TASSER} server has been developed to generate automated full-length 3D protein structural predictions where the benchmarked scoring system helps users to obtain quantitative assessments of the I-{TASSER} models. The output of the I-{TASSER} server for each query includes up to five full-length models, the confidence score, the estimated {TM}-score and {RMSD}, and the standard deviation of the estimations. The I-{TASSER} server is freely available to the academic community at http://zhang.bioinformatics.ku.edu/I-{TASSER}.},

The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are increasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are necessary in recognizing weak sequence-structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated, rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline applicable to whole genomes. Such large-scale modeling is likely to encourage new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional network.},

The identification of potentially remote homologues to be used as templates for modeling target sequences of unknown structure and their accurate alignment remain challenges, despite many years of study. The most recent advances have been in combining as many sources of information as possible--including amino acid variation in the form of profiles or hidden Markov models for both the target and template families, known and predicted secondary structures of the template and target, respectively, the combination of structure alignment for distant homologues and sequence alignment for close homologues to build better profiles, and the anchoring of certain regions of the alignment based on existing biological data. Newer technologies have been applied to the problem, including the use of support vector machines to tackle the fold classification problem for a target sequence and the alignment of hidden Markov models. Finally, using the consensus of many fold recognition methods, whether based on profile-profile alignments, threading or other approaches, continues to be one of the most successful strategies for both recognition and alignment of remote homologues. Although there is still room for improvement in identification and alignment methods, additional progress may come from model building and refinement methods that can compensate for large structural changes between remotely related targets and templates, as well as for regions of misalignment.},

At each position in a fold there are constraints on the identities of amino acids from both the three-dimensional structure and the function of the protein. To characterize and quantify the structural constraints, we have made a comparative analysis of families of homologous globular proteins. Residues are classified according to amino acid type, secondary structure, accessibility of the sidechain, and existence of hydrogen bonds from sidechain to other sidechains or peptide carbonyl or amide functions. There are distinct patterns of substitution especially where residues are both solvent inaccessible and hydrogen bonded through their sidechains. The patterns of residue substitution can be used to construct templates or to identify 'key' residues if one or more structures are known. Conversely, analysis of conversation and substitution across a large family of aligned sequences in terms of substitution profiles can allow prediction of tertiary environment or indicate a functional role. Similar analyses can be used to test the validity of putative structures if several homologous sequences are available.},

The history of the rate of discovery of new folds and the distribution of sequence families among known folds provide a means of estimating the underlying distribution of fold use. Previous models exploiting these data have led to rather different conclusions on the total number of folds. We present a new model, based on the notion that the folds used in biology fall naturally into three classes: unifolds, that is, folds found only in a single narrow sequence family; mesofolds, found in an intermediate number of families; and the previously noted superfolds, found in many protein families. We show that this model fits the available data well and has predicted the development of {SCOP} over the past 2 years. The principle implications of the model are as follows: (1) The vast majority of folds will be found in only a single sequence family; (2) the total number of folds is at least 10,000; and (3) 80\% of sequence families have one of about 400 folds, most of which are already known.},

Classification of proteins structures, which started in the 1970s with about a dozen structures, has continued with increasing enthusiasm, leading to two main fold classifications, {SCOP} and {CATH}, as well as many additional databases. Classification is complicated by deciding what constitutes a domain, the fundamental unit of structure. Also difficult is deciding when two given structures are similar. Like all of biology, fold classification is beset by exceptions to all rules. Thus, the perspectives of protein fold space that the fold classifications offer differ from each other. In spite of these ambiguities, fold classifications are useful for prediction of structure and function. Studying the characteristics of fold space can shed light on protein evolution and the physical laws that govern protein behavior.},

The recent design of proteins displaying very high sequence identities but different 3D structure allows the unique opportunity to address the protein-folding problem from a complementary perspective.

The analysis, based on 132 site-directed mutants, is fully consistent with the idea that protein topology is committed very early along the pathway of folding. Furthermore, data reveals that when folding approaches a perfect two-state scenario, as in the case of the G(A) domains, the structural features of the transition state appear very robust to changes in sequence composition. On the other hand, when folding is more complex and multistate, as for the G(B)s, there are alternative nuclei or accessible pathways that can be alternatively stabilized by altering the primary structure. The implications of our results in the light of previous work on the folding of different members belonging to the same protein family are discussed.},

In a few cases, computer simulations of the physical forces in chemically detailed models have now achieved the accurate folding of small proteins. We have learned that proteins fold rapidly because random thermal motions cause conformational changes leading energetically downhill toward the native structure, a principle that is captured in funnel-shaped energy landscapes. And thanks in part to the large Protein Data Bank of known structures, predicting protein structures is now far more successful than was thought possible in the early days. What began as three questions of basic science one half-century ago has now grown into the full-fledged research field of protein physical science.},

If so, then signals that arrest helix propagation--i.e., helix stop signals--should be found among these flanking residues. Evidence is presented for the existence of one such signal, a reciprocal backbone-side-chain hydrogen-bonding interaction, dubbed the capping box. In proteins, the capping box is found uniquely at helix N-termini. In peptides, the capping box can function as a helix stop signal, as shown in the work of Kallenbach and co-workers.},

These beta-breakers are conformationally homogeneous with respect to side-chain solvent accessibility and backbone dihedral angle profile. A sequence-structure correlation is noted: a restricted subset of amino acids is observed at these positions. Analysis of homologous protein sequences shows that these residues are more highly conserved than other residues in the loop.

	abstract = {The following three issues concerning the backbone dihedral angles of protein structures are presented. (1) How do the dihedral angles of the 20 amino acids depend on the identity and conformation of their nearest residues? (2) To what extent are the native dihedral angles determined by local (dihedral) potentials? (3) How to build a knowledge-based potential for a residue's dihedral angles, considering the identity and conformation of its nearest residues? We find that the dihedral angle distribution for a residue can significantly depend on the identity and conformation of its adjacent residues. These correlations are in sharp contrast to the Flory isolated-pair hypothesis. Statistical potentials are built for all combinations of residue triplets and depend on the dihedral angles between consecutive residues. First, a low-resolution potential is obtained, which only differentiates between the main populated basins in the dihedral angle density plots. Minimization of the dihedral potential for 125 test proteins reveals that most native alpha-helical residues (89\%) and a large fraction of native beta-sheet residues (47\%) adopt conformations close to their native one. For native loop residues, the percentage is 48\%. It is also found that this fraction is higher for residues away from the ends of alpha or beta secondary structure elements. In addition, a higher resolution potential is built as a function of dihedral angles by a smoothing procedure and continuous functions interpolations. Monte Carlo energy minimization with this potential results in a lower fraction for native beta-sheet residues. Nevertheless, because of the higher flexibility and entropy of beta structures, they could be preferred under the influence of non-local interactions. In general, most alpha-helices and many beta-sheets are strongly determined by the local potential, while the conformations in loops and near the end of beta-sheets are more influenced by non-local interactions.},

Although recent computational methods have achieved reasonably high accuracy for predicting secondary structures from amino acid sequences, a simple and fundamental empirical approach to characterize the amino acid composition of secondary structures was performed mainly in 1970s, with a small number of analyzed structures. To extend this classical approach using a large number of analyzed structures, here we characterized the amino acid sequences of secondary structures (12 154 alpha-helix units, 4592 3(10)-helix units, 16 787 beta-strand units, and 30 811 "other" units), using the representative three-dimensional protein structure records (1641 protein chains) from the Protein Data Bank. We first examined the length and the amino acid compositions of secondary structures, including rank order differences and assignment relationships among amino acids. These compositional results were largely, but not entirely, consistent with the previous studies. In addition, we examined the frequency of 400 amino acid doublets and 8000 triplets in secondary structures based on their relative counts, termed the availability. We identified not only some triplets that were specific to a certain secondary structure but also so-called zero-count triplets, which did not occur in a given secondary structure at all, even though they were probabilistically predicted to occur several times. Taken together, the present study revealed essential features of secondary structures and suggests potential applications in the secondary structure prediction and the functional design of protein sequences.},

We here found an efficient way to make a random step in a Monte Carlo procedure given knowledge of the energy or statistical properties of conformational subspaces (e.g. phi-psi zones or side-chain torsion angles). This biased probability Monte Carlo ({BPMC}) procedure randomly selects the subspace first, then makes a step to a new random position independent of the previous position, but according to the predefined continuous probability distribution. The random step is followed by a local minimization in torsion angle space. The positions, sizes and preferences for high-probability zones on phi-psi maps and chi-angle maps were calculated for different residue types from the representative set of 191 and 161 protein 3D-structures, respectively. A fast and precise method to evaluate the electrostatic energy of a protein in solution is developed and combined with the {BPMC} procedure. The method is based on the modified spherical image charge approximation, efficiently projected onto a molecule of arbitrary shape. Comparison with the finite-difference solutions of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation shows high accuracy for our approach. The {BPMC} procedure is applied successfully to the structure prediction of 12- and 16-residue synthetic peptides and the determination of protein structure from {NMR} data, with the immunoglobulin binding domain of streptococcal protein G as an example. The {BPMC} runs display much better convergence properties than the non-biased simulations. The advantage of a true global optimization procedure for {NMR} structure determination is its ability to cope with local minima originating from data errors and ambiguities in {NMR} data.},

There are three main conclusions from these results. First, the genetic algorithm is an effective method for searching amongst the compact conformations of a polypeptide chain. Second, the free energy function is generally able to select native-like conformations. However, some deficiencies are identified, and further development is proposed. Third, the selection of native-like conformations for some protein fragments establishes that in these cases the conformation observed in the full protein structure is largely context independent.

	title = {A Survey on Cellular Automata},
	abstract = {A cellular automaton is a decentralized computing model providing an excellent platform for performing complex computation with the help of only local information. Researchers, scientists and practitioners from different fields have exploited the {CA} paradigm of local information, decentralized control and universal computation for modeling different applications. This article provides a survey of available literature of some of the methodologies employed by researchers to utilize cellular automata for modeling purposes. The survey introduces the different types of cellular automata being used for modeling and the analytical methods used to predict its global behavior from its local configurations. It further gives a detailed sketch of the efforts undertaken to configure the local settings of {CA} from a given global situation; the problem which has been traditionally termed as the inverse problem. Finally, it presents the different fields in which {CA} have been applied. The extensive bibliography provided with the article will be of help to the new entrant as well as researchers working in this field.},

	abstract = {We consider the differences between the many-pathway protein folding model derived from theoretical energy landscape considerations and the defined-pathway model derived from experiment. A basic tenet of the energy landscape model is that proteins fold through many heterogeneous pathways by way of amino acid-level dynamics biased toward selecting native-like interactions. The many pathways imagined in the model are not observed in the structure-formation stage of folding by experiments that would have found them, but they have now been detected and characterized for one protein in the initial prenucleation stage. Analysis presented here shows that these many microscopic trajectories are not distinct in any functionally significant way, and they have neither the structural information nor the biased energetics needed to select native vs. nonnative interactions during folding. The opposed defined-pathway model stems from experimental results that show that proteins are assemblies of small cooperative units called foldons and that a number of proteins fold in a reproducible pathway one foldon unit at a time. Thus, the same foldon interactions that encode the native structure of any given protein also naturally encode its particular foldon-based folding pathway, and they collectively sum to produce the energy bias toward native interactions that is necessary for efficient folding. Available information suggests that quantized native structure and stepwise folding coevolved in ancient repeat proteins and were retained as a functional pair due to their utility for solving the difficult protein folding problem.},

This assertion of the authors was false when made in 1995, and since then considerable collaborative work between the experimental and theoretical communities has made an irrefutable case against the notion that the only way proteins fold is by a single obligate pathway (ref. 3 and …

Using a new testing set based on a set of 187 unique folds, and three-way cross-validation based on structural similarity criteria rather than sequence similarity criteria used previously (no similar folds were present in both the testing and training sets) the method presented here ({PSIPRED}) achieved an average Q3 score of between 76.5\% to 78.3\% depending on the precise definition of observed secondary structure used, which is the highest published score for any method to date.

How do trillions of individual neurons produce something as extraordinarily complex as consciousness? What is it that guides self-organizing structures like the immune system, the World Wide Web, the global economy, and the human genome? These are just a few of the fascinating and elusive questions that the science of complexity seeks to answer. In this remarkably accessible and companionable book, leading complex systems scientist Melanie Mitchell provides an intimate, detailed tour of the sciences of complexity, a broad set of efforts that seek to explain how large-scale complex, organized, and adaptive behavior can emerge from simple interactions among myriad individuals. Comprehending such systems requires a wholly new approach, one that goes beyond traditional scientific reductionism and that re-maps long-standing disciplinary boundaries. Based on her work at the Santa Fe Institute and drawing on its interdisciplinary strategies, Mitchell brings clarity to the workings of complexity across a broad range of biological, technological, and social phenomena, seeking out the general principles or laws that apply to all of them. She explores as well the relationship between complexity and evolution, artificial intelligence, computation, genetics, information processing, and many other fields. Richly illustrated and vividly written, Complexity: A Guided Tour offers a comprehensive and eminently comprehensible overview of the ideas underlying complex systems science, the current research at the forefront of this field, and the prospects for the field's contribution to solving some of the most important scientific questions of our time.},

Paradoxically, results of earlier quantitative analyses have suggested that the tendency for nonpolar residues to be buried within proteins is weak. However, such analyses merely classify residues as either "exposed" or "buried." In the experiment reported in this article proteins of known structure were used to measure the average area that each residue buries upon folding. This characteristic quantity, the average area buried, is correlated with residue hydrophobicity.},

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

In addition, considering long-range dependencies existing in amino acid sequences, we set up a bidirectional neural network consisting of gated recurrent unit to capture global contextual features. Furthermore, multitask learning is utilized to predict secondary structure labels and amino-acid solvent accessibility simultaneously.

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on {ImageNet} classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

	abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different "thinned" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

However, each fraction of a percent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture of {ResNet} blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting network structures wide residual networks ({WRNs}) and show that these are far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example, we demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms in accuracy and efficiency all previous deep residual networks, including thousand-layer-deep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on {CIFAR}, {SVHN}, {COCO}, and significant improvements on {ImageNet}.

	abstract = {Rectified activation units (rectifiers) are essential for state-of-the-art neural networks. In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit ({PReLU}) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. {PReLU} improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on the learnable activation and advanced initialization, we achieve 4.94\% top-5 test error on the {ImageNet} 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26\% relative improvement over the {ILSVRC} 2014 winner ({GoogLeNet}, 6.66\% [33]). To our knowledge, our result is the first to surpass the reported human-level performance (5.1\%, [26]) on this dataset.},

	abstract = {We present a new method for predicting the secondary structure of globular proteins based on non-linear neural network models. Network models learn from existing protein structures how to predict the secondary structure of local sequences of amino acids. The average success rate of our method on a testing set of proteins non-homologous with the corresponding training set was 64.3\% on three types of secondary structure (alpha-helix, beta-sheet, and coil), with correlation coefficients of C alpha = 0.41, C beta = 0.31 and Ccoil = 0.41. These quality indices are all higher than those of previous methods. The prediction accuracy for the first 25 residues of the N-terminal sequence was significantly better. We conclude from computational experiments on real and artificial structures that no method based solely on local information in the protein sequence is likely to produce significantly better results for non-homologous proteins. The performance of our method of homologous proteins is much better than for non-homologous proteins, but is not as good as simply assuming that homologous sequences have identical structures.},

	abstract = {A neural network algorithm is applied to secondary structure and structural class prediction for a database of 318 nonhomologous protein chains. Significant improvement in accuracy is obtained as compared with performance on smaller databases. A systematic study of the effects of network topology shows that, for the larger database, better results are obtained with more units in the hidden layer. In a 32-fold cross validated test, secondary structure prediction accuracy is 67.0\%, relative to 62.6\% obtained previously, without any evolutionary information on the sequence. Introduction of sequence profiles increases this value to 72.9\%, suggesting that the two types of information are essentially independent. Tertiary structural class is predicted with 80.2\% accuracy, relative to 73.9\% obtained previously. The use of a larger database is facilitated by the introduction of a scaled conjugate gradient algorithm for optimizing the neural network. This algorithm is about 10-20 times as fast as the standard steepest descent algorithm.},

	abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss {AdaMax}, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	abstract = {In the present work, we address the question of whether different amino acids have different beta-sheet initiating and terminating characteristics. Using a large scale analysis of parallel and antiparallel beta-sheets in a non-redundant dataset of proteins, we observed that most of the amino acids show significant under- or over-representation in at least one of the positions at the two ends of beta-sheets, which are denoted as N-cap and C-cap. In addition, based on statistical data and structural comparison, we found that certain amino acids, especially Asp, Asn, Gly and Pro have strong tendencies to block beta-sheet continuation. Hence, we can consider these residues as beta-sheet terminators. It was also proposed that the dipole moments in parallel beta-sheets, whose direction is from C-terminal (partially negative) to N-terminal (partially positive), are much stronger than has previously been suggested. In fact, enhancement of dipole moments in parallel beta-sheets is a result of the positioning of positively charged residues at N-cap and negatively charged residues at C-cap. This enhancement in dipole moment magnitude leads to strengthened dipolar interactions between parallel beta-sheets dipoles and other partners especially alpha-helices dipoles. The results provide an explanation for the antiparallel alignment of parallel beta-sheets with alpha-helices.},

Helix contents were measured by {CD} spectroscopy to obtain rank orders of capping preferences. The data were further analyzed by our modified Lifson-Roig helix-coil theory, which includes capping parameters (n and c), to find free energies of capping (-{RT} ln n and -{RT} ln c), relative to Ala. Results were obtained for charged and uncharged termini and for different charged states of titratable side chains. N-cap preferences varied from Asn (best) to Gln (worst). We find, as expected, that amino acids that can accept hydrogen bonds from otherwise free backbone {NH} groups, such as Asn, Asp, Ser, Thr, and Cys generally have the highest N-cap preference. Gly and acetyl group are favored, as are negative charges in side chains and at the N-terminus. Our N-cap preference scale agrees well with preferences in proteins. In contrast, we find little variation when changing the identity of the C-cap residue. We find no preference for Gly at the C-cap in contrast to the situation in proteins. Both N-cap and C-cap results for Tyr and Trp are inaccurate because their aromatic groups affect the {CD} spectrum. The data presented here are of value in rationalizing mutations at capping sites in proteins and in predicting the helix contents of peptides.},

In an alpha-helix, the first four {\textgreater}N-H groups and last four {\textgreater}C=O groups necessarily lack intrahelical hydrogen bonds. Instead, such groups are often capped by alternative hydrogen bond partners. This review enlarges our earlier hypothesis (Presta {LG}, Rose {GD}. 1988. Helix signals in proteins. Science 240:1632-1641) to include hydrophobic capping. A hydrophobic interaction that straddles the helix terminus is always associated with hydrogen-bonded capping. From a global survey among proteins of known structure, seven distinct capping motifs are identified-three at the helix N-terminus and four at the C-terminus. The consensus sequence patterns of these seven motifs, together with results from simple molecular modeling, are used to formulate useful rules of thumb for helix termination. Finally, we examine the role of helix capping as a bridge linking the conformation of secondary structure to supersecondary structure.},

Using this coarse-grained mapping, protein conformation can be approximated by a linear sequence of mesostates. These linear strings can then be aligned and assessed by conventional sequence-comparison methods.

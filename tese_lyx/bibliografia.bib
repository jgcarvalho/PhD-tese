	abstract = {We present a new method for predicting the secondary structure of globular proteins based on non-linear neural network models. Network models learn from existing protein structures how to predict the secondary structure of local sequences of amino acids. The average success rate of our method on a testing set of proteins non-homologous with the corresponding training set was 64.3\% on three types of secondary structure (alpha-helix, beta-sheet, and coil), with correlation coefficients of C alpha = 0.41, C beta = 0.31 and Ccoil = 0.41. These quality indices are all higher than those of previous methods. The prediction accuracy for the first 25 residues of the N-terminal sequence was significantly better. We conclude from computational experiments on real and artificial structures that no method based solely on local information in the protein sequence is likely to produce significantly better results for non-homologous proteins. The performance of our method of homologous proteins is much better than for non-homologous proteins, but is not as good as simply assuming that homologous sequences have identical structures.},

	abstract = {A neural network algorithm is applied to secondary structure and structural class prediction for a database of 318 nonhomologous protein chains. Significant improvement in accuracy is obtained as compared with performance on smaller databases. A systematic study of the effects of network topology shows that, for the larger database, better results are obtained with more units in the hidden layer. In a 32-fold cross validated test, secondary structure prediction accuracy is 67.0\%, relative to 62.6\% obtained previously, without any evolutionary information on the sequence. Introduction of sequence profiles increases this value to 72.9\%, suggesting that the two types of information are essentially independent. Tertiary structural class is predicted with 80.2\% accuracy, relative to 73.9\% obtained previously. The use of a larger database is facilitated by the introduction of a scaled conjugate gradient algorithm for optimizing the neural network. This algorithm is about 10-20 times as fast as the standard steepest descent algorithm.},

	abstract = {A method is presented for protein secondary structure prediction based on a neural network. A training phase was used to teach the network to recognize the relation between secondary structure and amino acid sequences on a sample set of 48 proteins of known structure. On a separate test set of 14 proteins of known structure, the method achieved a maximum overall predictive accuracy of 63\% for three states: helix, sheet, and coil. A numerical measure of helix and sheet tendency for each residue was obtained from the calculations. When predictions were filtered to include only the strongest 31\% of predictions, the predictive accuracy rose to 79\%.},
